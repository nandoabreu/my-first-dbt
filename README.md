# My first dbt project

This project is my first attempt to explore and run [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/product/what-is-dbt),
a powerful tool for transforming data in analytics engineering workflows.

The idea for this project came up during an interview where knowledge of dbt was mentioned as a requirement
or a "nice-to-have". Although I had no prior experience with dbt, the conversation took an interesting turn
when I was asked:

â€• Do you know Jinja?

For anyone familiar with Python frameworks like FastAPI, Django, or Flask, the name instantly rings a bell!
After the interview, I asked ChatGPT if dbt used Jinja the way I thought it did. AND IT DID! <3

This project represents my weekend/side-project to learn dbt hands-on and understand how it integrates with data workflows.
My goal is to explore how dbt transforms raw data into analytics-ready datasets through a simple, but structured project
and know about its:

- Data flow: source, staging, transformation, target
- Configuration and Engineering: how it works underneath
